This is the start of a beautiful... something.

An extremely-WIP resource viewer for Disgaea 1 and 2 and other games (hence the title). Among other things, there will eventually be a map viewer of some sort.

Mostly meant to allow easily browsing nested archives in various formats and (later) displaying and potentially editing the contents. The code is designed to relatively easily allow support for additional file formats. (See FormatSpec.cpp and the formats dir)
